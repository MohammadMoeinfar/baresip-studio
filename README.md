This is very basic Android Studio baresip project.

Includes PCMU/PCMA and opus codecs as well as ZRTP media encapsulation.

The static libraries and include files in distribution directory have
been produced using https://github.com/alfredh/baresip-android.

After cloning the project, in android-studio:

- Open an existing Android Studio project

- File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart -> Invalidate & Restart

Feedback welcome.
